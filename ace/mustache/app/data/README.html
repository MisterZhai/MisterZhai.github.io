<p>Please note that these data are only for demonstration purposes. So for ease of use I saved them as json/csv files.</p>
<p>A better way would be using databases to save your data and perhaps using MVC methods and frameworks for your application.<br>In that case you load your data within a controller and pass it onto the view.</p>
<p>You can also use a framework such as Zend, CI, Yii etc for PHP,<br>or Rails for Ruby and other ones for different languages,<br>and they all have bindings for Mustache if you like to use.</p>
